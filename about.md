# About me

I'm a researcher working on the energy models to understand energy and climate interactions a little better. Open source community has given me a lot. And I would be happy to give back. 

I have decided to start this blog to share some insights and experiences collected throughout my research journey. At the moment the content is in transition moving from another platform and (hopefully) will re-appear soon.
