I'm an energy researcher with a background in heat and mass transfer physics. Currently I'm working on an intersection of the energy modeling and climate science. Data science and data analysis belong to my everyday working toolsets. 

I very much hope that open source, open science and open data will help to overcome crisices we are facing nowadays. And I would be happy to contribute. Here I'm posting my working notes, data science tutorials and climate science introductions. You are free to reuse and redistribute them with the authorship indication. You can contact me via enemod at the protonmail.com.

Building of this site was a great fun with GitHub Pages, [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and the [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Thank you guys!
